                SLOW FURNITURE THESIS PUBLISHED (2023)
            </h1>
            <p>Finally, after a lot of work, I'm proud to say that my thesis project 'Slow Furniture: Disseny d'un moble evolutiu, durador i emocional' has been published at the repository of the Universitat Politècnica de València. The work proposes a solution to the growing amount of furniture discarded after its single life cycle, especially those intended for use by children. The project investigates the creation of an evolving piece of furniture capable of changing its typology, accompanying children during their growth and even being kept until adulthood. Based on the principles of the Circular Economy, the proposal proposes a product that can be transformed, extending its useful life in different cycles and thus maintaining not only its physical value but also all the resources used during its manufacture. Furthermore, it is designed to create an emotional link between the person and the object that motivates the individual to give second and third lives to the pieces of furniture, thus delaying as much as possible or even avoiding their arrival in the landfill.</p>

                ALE-HOP'S TALENT-HOP <br>SCHOLARSHIP AWARDS (2023)
            </h1>
            <p>I am pleased to announce that once again, I've been awarded second place at the Talent-Hop Scholarship, organized by ALE-HOP and the Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV). This year, the proposed challenge was to improve the company’s cable packaging, considering its utilities, exposure, brand values, and zero waste. Despite having yet to win first prize on any of the two occasions I have presented myself, I would like to thank Ale-Hop and the UPV for recognizing my work and the opportunity to develop my skills.</p>
