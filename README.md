# (WIP) New portfolio website

In this web I will showcase all my previous work as well as a blog where I will try to keep everyone updated with the things that are going on and a lab where I will share all the experimentation and open sorce code/files that I use. 

Would love you to give it a [look](https://jmuozan.github.io/jorgemunyozz.github.io/) and share it if you like it or you now someone who can be interested.

Also you can check inside ```OTHER/REFERENCES``` the websites I used as an inspiration to build this one. Feel free to clone the repository and change whatever you want to build your website.
