# (WIP) New portfolio website

In this web I will showcase all my previous work as well as a blog where I will try to keep everyone updated with the things that are going on and a lab where I will share all the experimentation and open sorce code/files that I use. 

Would love you to give it a [look](https://jmuozan.github.io/jorgemunyozz.github.io/) and share it if you like it or you now someone who can be interested.

Also you can check inside `OTHER/REFERENCES` the websites I used as an inspiration to build this one. Feel free to clone the repository and change whatever you want to build your website.

Also feel free to take as much of the code as you need just `git clone https://github.com/jmuozan/jorgemunyozz.github.io.git` on your terminal. ;)

## Things to add (or change) to the website:

- [x] REDO LAB
- [x] WORKS MENU CHANGE
- [ ] INDIVIDUAL LAB PROJECTS POSTS
- [x] CHANGE GALLERY
- [ ] CHANGE ABOUT
- [ ] CHANGE OUTREACH
- [ ] LINKS TO CERTIFICATES
- [ ] GALLERY ADD IMAGES
- [ ] OPTIMIZE WEB



Students engaged in this project are tasked with developing an architectural system using topological optimization, a method commonly used in engineering to optimize material distribution for structural efficiency. Through this approach, the project merges computational design with performance-oriented material application, resulting in structures that are light, stable, and resource-efficient. The final designs, such as modular furniture pieces, will be assessed based on efficiency, stability, lightness, and design performance.

The project emphasizes hands-on experience with robotic kinematics, simulation, and control, equipping participants with the skills to bridge fabrication constraints and architectural goals in a seamless "file-to-factory" workflow. This research contributes to the architectural field by showcasing how robotic fabrication with biomaterials can foster environmentally responsible and technically sophisticated building solutions.
