# (WIP) New portfolio website

In this web I will showcase all my previous work as well as a blog where I will try to keep everyone updated with the things that are going on and a lab where I will share all the experimentation and open sorce code/files that I use. 

Would love you to give it a [look](https://jmuozan.github.io/jorgemunyozz.github.io/) and share it if you like it or you now someone who can be interested.

Also you can check inside `OTHER/REFERENCES` the websites I used as an inspiration to build this one. Feel free to clone the repository and change whatever you want to build your website.

Also feel free to take as much of the code as you need just `git clone https://github.com/jmuozan/jorgemunyozz.github.io.git` on your terminal. ;)
